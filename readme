LogicGridMaster is an advanced Sudoku-solving application that utilizes sophisticated algorithms to solve puzzles of varying difficulty levels, from easy to expert. This project was built 
using Java, focusing on efficient puzzle-solving logic and algorithm optimization.

Key Features: 
Ability to solve Sudoku puzzles of different grid sizes and complexities.
Implements advanced techniques such as recursion and constraint propagation for accurate and fast solutions.
Optimized for performance with minimal computational overhead.

Technologies Used:
Java: Core programming language for algorithm implementation and puzzle logic.
OOP Principles: Object-oriented design for modular and scalable code architecture.

Future Enhancements:
Support for additional puzzle types (e.g., non-standard Sudoku).
A feature to create new puzzles using random generation techniques.
